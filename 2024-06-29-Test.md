### Execute code once or first time execution inÂ Swift

For many years I was executing some of UI first time configuration in viewWillAppear, viewDidAppear, updateViewConstraints, viewWillLayoutSubviews ans viewDidLayoutSubviews.
The well know solutions which gave a possibility to determine if a specific method was executing for first time was creating a private variable isFirstTimeXXX of type boolean.
Pro of that solutions:
implementation is simple

Cons:

each method which needed that logic had to have it's local variable
variables could be used in other functions by mistake or by desing

Example

```swift
class Toto: UIViewController {
    
    private var isViewWillAppearExecutingForFirstTime: Bool = true
    private var isViewDidAppearExecutingForFirstTime: Bool = true
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        if isViewWillAppearExecutingForFirstTime {
            // this variable should not be used here
        }
    }

    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillAppear(animated)
        if isViewWillAppearExecutingForFirstTime {
            // code to execute only on first execution of viewWillAppear
            isViewWillAppearExecutingForFirstTime = false
        }
    }
    
    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)
        if isViewDidAppearExecutingForFirstTime {
            // code to execute only on first execution of viewDidAppear
            isViewDidAppearExecutingForFirstTime = false
        }
    }
}
```
